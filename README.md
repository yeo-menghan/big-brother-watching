## üîç Overview
Screen Activity Monitor captures data about your active applications at regular intervals, providing insights into how you spend your time on your computer. This tool helps you:

- Track which applications you use most frequently
- Analyze your productivity patterns
- Identify potential distractions
- Visualize your screen time distribution

All data is stored locally on your machine - no data is ever sent to external servers, ensuring your privacy.

## ‚ú® Features
- Privacy-First Approach: All monitoring and data storage happens locally on your device
- Customizable Monitoring: Set your desired capture interval and monitoring duration
- Real-Time Progress: View monitoring progress with a live status bar
- Detailed Analysis: Summarize application usage with statistics and visualizations
- Data Export: Download your activity logs as CSV files for further analysis
- Minimal Resource Usage: Designed to run in the background with minimal impact on system performance
